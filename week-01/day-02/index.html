            <h2> Developer </h2>
            <p> I am a <strong>junior software developer</strong>, my main skills are: being responsible, good time management, generally a very nice person. :) </p>
            <p> I believe being a great developer is not just about knowing code, but also being tolerant towards other people, and their way of seeing the world. When I think about creating something, I imagine I am only adding my small part to a bigger set of things. </p>
